# Drought Prediction Using Computer Vision

This project implements a computer vision-based drought classification system using Landsat-8 satellite imagery.

## Features
- NDVI, NDWI, EVI, LST, VCI, and GLCM texture computation
- Pixel-wise drought risk classification (Normal, Moderate, Severe)
- Neural network classifier using TensorFlow
- Visualization of drought indices and results

## Folder Structure
- `/code`: All scripts and notebooks
- `/data`: Instructions or sample for dataset
- `/results`: Output drought maps, logs
- `/report`: Final report PDF

## How to Run
Open the Colab notebook in `/code`, mount your Drive, upload a `.tar` Landsat scene, and run all cells.
